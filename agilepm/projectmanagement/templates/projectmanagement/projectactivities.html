<h2>Business case</h2>
<p>In Prince2 all projects must have a documented business justification. A business case is developed at the beginning of a project and provides the cost, benefits, expected benefits, risk and timescales. It confirms whether the project is desirable, viable and achievable.</p>

 <p> The business case is reviewed and updated as it develops and evolves and formally verified by the project board at each key decision point.</p>
  
<h2> Project planning </h2>
  <ul>
<li>  Design a plan (project plan (high level), detailed level plans - stage plan, team plan (optional), exception plan)</li>
<li>Define and analyse the products</li>
<li>Identify activities and dependancies</li>
<li>Prepare estimates</li>
<li>Prepare a schedule</li>
<li>Analyse risks to the plan</li>
<li>Document and publish the plan</li></ul>

<h2>Measuring performance</h2>
<p>The six aspects of performance are</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Scope</li>
<li>Benefits</li>
<li>Risk</li></ul>
<p>These aspects are measurable and can therefore be managed. Any of these aspects could change which would in turn affect the other aspects.</p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> is an uncertain event or set of events that should it occur will have an effect on achievement of objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong> is something that has or will happen. (If a risk is not dealt with it becomes an issue.)
</p>
 <p> Prince2 minimum requirements in relation to risk are</p>
<ul> <li></li>Define risk management approach</li>
  <li>Maintain some form of risk register</li>
    <li>Ensure that project risks are:
      <ul>
    <li>  identified (lessons log), </li>
    <li> assessed (probability and proximity), </li>
      <li>managed (plan mitigations) and </li>
        <li>reviewed (establish owner) throughout the project lifecycle</li>
    </ul>
      <li>Use lessons to inform risk identification and management</li> </ul>

     <p> Make sure there is good communication between risk owners, project manager and stakeholders </p>
